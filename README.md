This repository houses my NixOS configuration. It is [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)-based and utilizes [impermanence](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Impermanence) to 
further explore reproducibility.

While only fitted for my Dell Inspiron Laptop at the moment, this might be extended to support multiple systems later on.

## üß± Structure 

### üìÅ modules

This folder contains all the configuration for the system, organized into modular ``.nix`` files, grouped by functionality. </br>
A few selected 'highlights' among these include:

**‚ùÑÔ∏è boot.nix** and **‚ùÑÔ∏è persistence.nix**

These two files realize the impermanent aspect of the system. On every boot, the ``/root`` partition is reset to a blank state that was recorded after the initial installation.
Important files that need to survive this (primarily file in ``/etc/``) are either:
  - Symlinked from a separate ``/persist`` partition
  - or created through Nix itself and symlinked from the Nix Store
